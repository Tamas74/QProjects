                TimeActivityGraph will set GraphPoint instance as the DataContext for the UIElement supplied as DataMarkerElement.
                This instance will contain details about the start and end co-ordinates of the interpolation line with respect to the current panel.
                If start time belongs to previous panel, then X1 property will have value as lesser than 0,
                If end time belongs to previous panel, then X2 property will have value as lesser than 0,
